## Introduction

As a software developer learning networking concepts, I've created this repository to document my journey of learning both networking theory and Go programming. The projects included here aim to cover a variety of networking topics and provide practical demonstrations of how these concepts can be implemented using Go.

Feel free to explore the projects, use them as learning resources, and even contribute your own projects to expand the collection.

## Projects

1. [UDP Client-Server Communication](/UdpClientServer) - Demonstrates a simple UDP client-server communication setup, where the server listens for incoming UDP messages on localhost and converts received text to uppercase and returns it to the client as a response, while the client sends user-input text to the server using UDP.

## Getting Started

Each project is contained within its own directory.
